				<p >Hi everyone, welcome to my website! My name is Phillip Ou and I am a software engineer from Los Angeles, California. I am the  currently majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As both a First Generation American and a First Generation College Student, I've had the opportunity to gain a variety of unique experiences, perspectives, and passions. I've had to learn English as a second language, gone through the recruiting process as a student-athlete, learned how to make mobile apps, taken a Gap Year, fallen in love with technology, and much more! Feel free to browse around the site and contact me if you have any more questions. </p>
